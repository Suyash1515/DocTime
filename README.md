DocTime is a modern, modular web application designed to streamline processes in the healthcare domain, particularly focusing on features like appointment booking and user management. The project is divided into distinct modules for better scalability and maintainability:

Frontend:

Built with modern JavaScript frameworks (likely React or Vue) and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Features an interactive design to enable users to browse, book, and manage appointments seamlessly.
Uses Vite for faster development builds and efficient project bundling.
Backend:

Powered by Node.js with Express.js, providing robust server-side functionality and APIs for the application.
Implements secure authentication, efficient routing, and database interactions using defined models and controllers.
Middleware ensures smooth processing of tasks like user validation, error handling, and request logging.
Admin Panel:

A separate interface tailored for administrators to oversee and manage system operations.
Includes features like user management, appointment tracking, and system monitoring.
Built with the same technologies as the frontend for consistency and ease of maintenance.
Technologies and Features:

Database: Likely uses MongoDB or a similar database for storing user data, appointment details, and other information.
Security: Environment variables (.env) are used to safeguard sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
Scalability: Modular structure allows easy addition of new features or modifications.
Potential Use Cases:
Booking doctor appointments online.
Managing patient records and schedules.
Providing a dashboard for healthcare administrators.
This project showcases a well-architected solution for modern healthcare systems, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and security.
